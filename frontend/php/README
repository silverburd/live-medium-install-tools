Set up username and password for manage.php

1.) Go into the root directory and type:

	htpasswd -c .htpasswd username

2.) You will be prompted for a new password.

3.) After typing in the password you will have a new file called ".htpasswd" with the new user information.

NOTE: After creating the first user, you will no longer have to use the "-c".
