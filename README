debian live as firmware. Hence data loss on the target will occur. Use at your
own risk!

Did you see the part where data loss on the target will occur?

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The below is the starting point for testing live-medium-install.

1.) Download a debian live image. See http://live-systems.org/cdimage/release/


2.) Boot the downloaded image on the computer you wish to install and run debian live as firmware.
Note: I do most of my testing with a VirtualBox image.

3.) Become the root user:

sudo -i

4.) Next we need to download live-medium-install (see VCS for link to the latest live-medium-install):

wget install.live-systems.org/scripts/live-medium-install

5.) Make the script we downloaded executable:

chmod +x ./live-medium-install

6.) Run the script:

./live-medium-install

From here the script will check for some dependencies and prompt for information to perform the install.
